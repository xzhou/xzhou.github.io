Final Project Guidelines<br>
<br>
We are quickly approaching the end of the semester.   Here is the plan for the rest of the classes.  

<br>
<br>
The final talks will be arranged on Apr. 23, 25 and the final week
(probably Apr. 30 but I need to check). Each talk, including questions
and answers, is budgeted at 15 minutes. You are supposed to convince
the audience the novelty of your project, its utility and the concrete
progress you make on the project. I encourage you to demonstrate your
prototype systems during the talks. I will announce the arrangement of
the talks this weekend. <br>
<br>
I expect to receive your final report before 11:59 EDT on Wednesday,
May 2. Please submit it to zhou@indiana.edu, with the subject beginning
with "Final Report for I521". The final report is supposed to be
formatted like a research paper: no less than 7 pages for small
projects (single person) and 9 pages for group projects (two persons),
double column, 11 fonts, single space, 1 inch margins. It should
include: introduction, related work, design of the techniques (or
equivalent section(s)), evaluations, discussions, conclusion,
references and appendix if any. Please try to make the writing as
formal as possible, thinking about a paper ready to submit.
